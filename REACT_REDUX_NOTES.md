# W5 L2 Introduction to Redux
  - Redux enforces a specific structure as well as conventions for state
  - Redux enforces 3 principles:
    - single source of truth
    - state is read-only
    - changes are made with pure functions
  - anatomy of redux
    - stores - the redux store is where all state resides. it is our "single source of truth"
    - reducers - reducers will update (or mutate) state by communicating with the store
    - actions
